# Android-authentication
A simple Android app that connects to a server to perform some basic user authentication.
One of the projects I made when learning Android. There are some remenants in the code about a "Cookbook" app that I was working on which I pulled this code from but otherwise it should be a self-contained application that prompts the user with a sign-in screen and lets them create an account or sign in to an existing one, and once logged in, they will be taken to the app's "front page".

The server-side PHP scripts that I used for authentication are hosted in my Serverside-Authentication repo: https://github.com/Dekunutter/Serverside-Authentication

Any links or server credentials in the codebase do not point to a real server. I no longer maintain any server for this project so the connections will fail but the source code still provides a solid basis on which I could base an Android login service in the future.
